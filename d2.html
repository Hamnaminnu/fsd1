        The northern coast of Kerala is way less touristy than its southern coast. 
        This is an attraction in its every right. The major draw card of this end of the coastal Kerala 
        is the underdeveloped but very beautiful beaches found here. Besides this the enthralling theyyam 
        possession rituals conducted here are also equally magnificent. 
        Kannur was then also christened as the ‘great emporium of spice trade’ by the explorer Marco Polo.
