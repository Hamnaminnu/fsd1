        Pathanamthitta is one of the fastest-growing cities in India, and one of the first of its kind in the country to go completely cashless in 
        2017. As part of a government initiative to support e-wallets, the Pathanamthitta district collectorate office has rejected the use of cash 2017 
        onwards. This city is also considered the seat of Hindu mythology, since its home to the Sabarimala temple, which attracts millions of faithful devotees 
        every year.

        <h4>Pandalam Palace</h4>
        <p>The Pandalam family was an off-shoot of the mighty Pandya dynasty, and in spite of being a small faction, commanded great wealth and respect in what is 
          now modern Kerala, albeit thousands of years ago. The Pandalam Palace is maintained in their memory  of Pandya and Malabar 
          architecture.

      <h4>Aranmula</h4>
      <p>Aranmula, a UN heritage site, is famous for two things - the boat race and the Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple. Then, you can also buy an 
        Aranmula Kannadi, an intricately-designed metal mirror made using a secret method that’s been passed down from over generations. It’s said to have a 
        healing influence.

      <h4>Thriveni Sangamam</h4>
      <p>Hindus believe that rivers originating from holy places have a cleansing effect, and a dip in one will erase all the sins in the past. Now, that 
        depends on how much of a believer you are, but at Thriveni Sangamam, there’s one thing for sure - it’s one of the most breathtaking places to visit in 
        Pathanamthitta

        <h4>Konni Forest </h4>
        <p>The Konni Forest reserves are a great place to spend a day with your family if you’re visiting Pathanamthitta, especially because it’s a very 
          well-organised forest resort with excellent guides willing to take you around the place. If you can visit the elephant training centre where they break in 
          wild elephants. Or, ride the bowl-shaped boats.<br></P>

        <h4>Gavi</h4>
        <p>Gavi is a carefully-protected natural reserve inhabited by some of the rarest and most elusive animals known to man. That’s why you have to be quiet, 
          and carry your own litter when in Gavi. The local authorities, along with the villagers, go to great lengths to maintain this ecological vault of sorts. 
          Gavi is a great place to go to trekking

        <h4>Kaviyoor Rock Temple</h4>
        <p>Kaviyoor Rock Temple is the only cave temple left in the state which glorifies the culture of the area more that its spiritual aspect.
          This ancient cave temple established in Tamil Pallava style is devoted to Lord Hanuman, the Monkey God. Thus, one can witness the large number of monkey 
          in an around the temple who are feasted on regular basis.
